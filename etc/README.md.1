# compiler-2: baz
experimental compiler of minimalistic language to nasm x86_64 for linux

intention:
* minimalistic language
* gain experience writing compilers
* generate handwritten-like assembler compiled by nasm for x86_64
* program with a super loop and non-reentrant inlined functions

supports:
* built-in integer types (64, 32, 16, 8 bit)
* built-in boolean type
* user defined types (in progress)
* inlined functions
* keywords: inline, func, field, var, loop, if, else, continue, break

howto:
* to compile the compiler that compiles 'prog.baz' and assembles the generated code run 'make.sh'
* after that use './run-baz.sh myprogram.baz' or './run-baz.sh' to compile and run 'prog.baz'
* to run the tests 'qa/coverage/run-tests.sh' and see coverage report in 'qa/coverage/report/'
