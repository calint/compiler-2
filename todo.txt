[ ] examine expression, expr_ops_list, stmt_call relation
[ ] token.compile assumes is_str is field
[ ]   review fragile implementation
[ ] negated subexpression. i.e. 'not (a=1 and b=2)'
[ ] why is the binary so big although in-line is turned off in make.sh?
[ ] tokenizer to keep track of line-number instead of counting it at every call
[ ] make sub lists taking in account precedence of 'and' over 'or'
      i.e. 'a or b and c or d' -> 'a or (b and c) or d'

[ ] clang-format everything for less dess code?
[ ] compile for pczero task
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] when calling non-inlined functions the allocated register is pushed and popped
    although it hasn't been assigned. keep track of that in toc and optimize away
    the push/pop
[x] all allocated registers pushed before a call not necessary
[x] registers get clobbered in non-inlined functions
[x] rax gets clobbered in recursive functions
[x] non-inlined function calls
[x]   review
[-]     rbp=rsp before pushing arguments and at the beginning of functions
          can be optimized if nasm ident not hard-coded [rbp+...]
        example: "rbp" or "rsp" as argument to toc.nasm_ident(ident,"rbp",displacement)
          where displacement is used when pushing arguments to compensate for the moving rsp
[x] keyword 'inline'. func inline foo()...
[x] fix generated code of "if (a=1 and b=2) or (c=3 and d=4)"
