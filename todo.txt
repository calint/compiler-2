[x] fix generated code
        jmp cmp_13_26
        cmp_13_26:
[ ]   review fragile implementation
[ ] short-hand boolean expression i.e. if a or b
[x] review the ugly 'if' code
[x] variant instead of stmt_if_bool_op_list extends stmt_if_bool_op
[ ] negated subexpression. i.e. not (a=1 and b=2)
[ ] non-inlined function calls
[ ] why is the binary so big although in-line is turned off in make.sh?
[ ] tokenizer to keep track of line-number instead of counting it at every call
[ ] implement division op
[ ] assembler 64 bit code
[ ] make sub lists taking in account precedence of 'and' over 'or'
      i.e. a or b and c or d -> a or (b and c) or d
[ ] return statement
